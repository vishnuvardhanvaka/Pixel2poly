This folder consists of process to train the pifu model on 3d obj's along with there texture maps (using baking)
The folder contains:
  apps
  lib
  sample_images
  scripts
  env_sh.npy
  environment.yml
  requirements.txt
The app function needs to be set before the model is trained. 
Follow these steps:
step1: Clone this repo using !git clone ###

step2: move to pifu_train dir using " %cd pifu_train "

step3: Install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt using " !pip install -r requirements.txt ".

step4: change the n=40 value in the apps/prt_util.py line 125 file to a value that your machine gpu can handle like n=4.

step5: Create a folder named "Data" in pifu_train dir and store the 3d .obj files(models) in it and create a "tex" folder in the "Data" dir and then add texture file into it ending with "_dif_2k.jpg".

step6: Run this script to create a bounce folder of (bounceN.txt, face.npy) - " !python /content/PIFu/apps/prt_util.py -i /content/PIFu/Data/penguin4_00.obj " {you can replace the penguin4_00.obj with the name of the obj file you have in the "Data" folder"} **RUN THIS COMMAND FOR THE EACH OF THE OBJ FILES THAT YOU WANT TO TRAIN ON TO GENERATE MULTIPLE bounceN.txt file for individula .obj's **

step7: Run this script to render all the angles of obj object and collect each of the frames into the Train/RENDER folder - " !python /content/PIFu/render_data.py -i /content/PIFu/Data/penguin4_00.obj -o /content/PIFu/Train -e " ** This is usefull to train the model on different multiple view angles. 
*** NOTE: play with the " cam.ortho_ratio " value in the line 149. I used a value of 0.8 insted of "0.4 * (512 / im_size)"- but the results are not that good for this value. play with it if you want.

step8: downloade the pre-trained model that was trained on the human dataset. using: " !sh ./scripts/download_trained_model.sh "
**** NOTE:  #download if you train on top of the model trained on human dataset
            #after download you will need to change the name and location of the checkpoint
            #when you run the train script it will throw an error that's where you have to move the checkpoint too
